# Foodberg — Historical Food Price Explorer

**State verified: 2026-05-22**

**A full-stack web application for exploring historical food commodity prices, built with React and FastAPI. 169,000+ records from 5 public data sources covering 50+ agricultural commodities.**

> **Project state (2026-05-22):** Two tracks. (1) The web app — backend DB ~169K records, working locally, not deployed. (2) The KB wishlist track — v4 wishlist current (1,985 entries / 105 categories, `2026.06.20 KB Wishlist v4 Global`); ~802 source PDFs acquired into `Inputs` (2026-05-10) but **not yet extracted**. No HDARP campaign has run — no `Knowledge_Base`, no `BATCH_STATE.json`. See `PROGRESS_LOG.md`.

## Why This Exists

Understanding food prices requires combining data from scattered government sources (USDA, BLS, FAO, World Bank, FRED) into a single queryable interface. Foodberg harmonizes these into a SQLite database with a React frontend for interactive exploration — designed for researchers, journalists, and historically minded chefs who want to see the data behind the food system.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andenick/Foodberg.git
cd Foodberg

# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate            # Windows (or: source venv/bin/activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m database.import_all    # Populate database from public APIs
python main.py                   # Starts on http://localhost:8000

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev                      # Starts on http://localhost:3000
```

## Features

- **Food Price Index**: Composite indices for 6 food groups (meat, dairy, cereals, oils, sugar, produce) from FAO and BLS data, 1990–present
- **Price Explorer**: Browse 50+ agricultural commodities from USDA WASDE data
- **Geographic Comparison**: Compare prices across US states and regions
- **Historical Trends**: Multi-commodity comparison with correlation analysis
- **Live Terminal Prices**: USDA Market News API integration (requires `USDA_API_KEY`)
